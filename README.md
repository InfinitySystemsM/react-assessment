## Improvements Made

- Implemented a simple ORM and a database file to simulate entity interaction and provide a realistic API simulation.
- Used Next.js API routes to simulate backend API calls, allowing for a more modular and scalable architecture.

## What Would Be Changed with More Time

- A real database would be implemented to properly handle data loading and interaction between the API and persistent storage.
- Additional features and optimizations could be added, such as authentication, advanced filtering, and improved error handling.
